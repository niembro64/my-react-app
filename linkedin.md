# 🎮 I Recreated Axelrod's Tournament... But Made It Chaotic

Remember when Robert Axelrod asked game theorists to submit strategies for an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournament in 1980?

**Tit-for-Tat won.** Nice guys finished first. Revolutionary stuff. 📚

But I thought: *"What if instead of polite academics submitting FORTRAN code, we had little creatures running around trying to survive?"*

So I built this. 🔬

## What happens:

🟢 **Always Cooperate** - The optimists. Bless their hearts.
🔴 **Always Defect** - The "it's just business" crowd
🔵 **Tit-for-Tat** - The golden child. Starts nice, matches energy.
🟣 **Tit-for-Two-Tats** - Extra forgiving. Gets exploited. A lot.
🟡 **Win-Stay Lose-Shift** - The experimenters
🟠 **Grim Trigger** - Forgiveness? Never heard of her.
⚪ **Random** - Chaos incarnate. Here for the vibes.

## The twist:

Instead of abstract payoff matrices, creatures actually **chase victims**, **flee from threats**, **hunt for food**, and **reproduce** when they're doing well.

Watching Always Defect chase down Always Cooperate while Tit-for-Tat builds a peaceful commune in the corner is... *chef's kiss* 👨‍🍳

## The lesson Axelrod taught us still holds:

Be nice. Be forgiving. But don't be a pushover.

Also: Random is surprisingly resilient when nobody can predict what you'll do next. 🎲
